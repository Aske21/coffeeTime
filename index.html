                    <h2>About Coffee Time</h2>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            An Idea came to me one day while i was drinking my coffee, the idea of being able to arange meetings with random people and enjoy a cup of coffe with them.
                            The idea seemed sceptical at first though a lot of people liked it. Meeting new people always seemed scary and thats why I thought about making a web application which allows you to interact with anyone you might like online.
                            This page is mostly for those people who either have time and want someone to drink coffee and talk about things they have in common, and for the people who just need to kill an hour or two.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Our goal</h2>
                    <br>
                        <p>
                            Our goal is to kill boredom as much as we can. Connecting our people is our main goal and we will keep working on that as much as we can. 
                            Coffee is one of the oldest drinks to connect itself to a social activity, the social activity of drinking together as a group is in fact it an almost uniquely human activity, drinking is essential to survival and at one point in human history the habit of drinking together has become one of the most acceptable forms of human interaction and socialization all over the world.Today the coffee house is a much more relaxed version of the ancient coffee house, the corporate world stops for a moment when drinking coffee to enjoy the company of other people, most of them strangers that happen to enjoy a cup of coffee on the end of a working day or on their way to some other place. No matter how you examine it, coffee is still binding people together in one way or the other.

                            Coffee houses, as meeting places, help facilitate the spread of information. This occurs informally, as a result of socialising, and, in some cases, through the availability of notice boards. As information passes through a social network, individuals within the community influence each other. The behaviours and norms that come to be adopted are the reflection of this ongoing interaction and collective cognition.
